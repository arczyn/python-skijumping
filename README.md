Web scraping of FIS website to save results of ski jumping event to .CSV file.

This script allows you to save results of selected ski jumping event (like World Cup competition) from the official website of FIS to CSV file. I will use it to complete my archive of ski jumping results and make some custom rankings and analysis.
